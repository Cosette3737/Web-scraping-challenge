## Scraping ##
The initial part of this project included scraping data from various sites with the help of Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Splinter and Pandas.


## MongoDB and Flask Application ##
After the initial step of scraping information, with the help of Flask and MongoDB, a new index.html is created using all scraped data from previous step. In order to complete this a scrape route was used to import all the data into the displayed HTML page.
